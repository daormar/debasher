DeBasher
========

**DeBasher** is a flow-based programming extension for Bash. `Flow-based
programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming>`_
combines data flow programming with component-based software engineering
to enable the implementation of highly modular programs that exploit the
parallelism implicitly determined by data dependencies between
components.

DeBasher implements many features considered useful in similar tools,
such as parallel process execution with data dependency handling;
automatic error handling; result reproducibility through containers or
package managers; generation of dependency graphs; and compatibility
with high performance clusters or cloud infrastructure.

However, DeBasher also implements advanced features that are not usual
or cannot be found at all in other solutions, including workflow
interactivity; support for complex workflows that include cycles;
implementation of stateful processes; and ability to combine multiple
workflows at runtime
