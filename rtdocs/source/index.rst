DeBasher
========

**DeBasher** is a flow-based programming extension for Bash. The
`flow-based programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming>`_ combines data
flow programming with component-based software engineering to enable the
implementation of highly modular programs that exploit the parallelism
implicitly determined by data dependencies between components.
